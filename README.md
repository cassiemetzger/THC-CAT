## Data products
This repository contains two data sets: primary catalog [THC_catalog.fits](./CATALOGS/THC_catalog.fits) and supplementary catalog [WISE_EROSITA_ALLmatches.fits](./CATALOGS/WISE_EROSITA_ALLmatches.fits). 

[THC_catalog.fits](./CATALOGS/THC_catalog.fits) contains the 121 THC sources that pass all parameters detailed in Figure 1. It is produced using [THC_algorithm.ipynb](THC_algorithm.ipynb). 

[WISE_EROSITA_ALLmatches.fits](./CATALOGS/WISE_EROSITA_ALLmatches.fits) contains all 5482 sources that pass the IR magnitude and color cuts (Steps 1&2 in Section 3 of Metzger et al. 2025) and have WISEA and 1eRASS counterparts within 5'' of one another. 


## Scripts
Please note that all scripts have input files from a number of catalogs that are not included in this repository and must be retrieved separately. As a result, you will need to edit the paths in the scripts to match your local directory. 


[wise_filter.sh](wise_filter.sh) takes in the ALLWISE catalog and returns a revised catalog that contains only the sources that fall within magnitude and color cuts described in Figure 1. **This script must be run first.**

[THC_algorithm.ipynb](THC_algorithm.ipynb) selects 121 TeV-emitting HBL Candidate sources and cross-matches them with various multi-wavelength catalogs. The details of this script are shown in Figure 1. 

[WISE_EROSITA_ALLmatches.ipynb](WISE_EROSITA_ALLmatches.ipynb) selects 5482 sources that have ALLWISE counterparts within the accepted magntiudes and colors and have an eRASS1_Main counterpart within 5''. These 5482 sources are then cross-matched with the same multi-wavelength catalogs used in the THC algorithm.
